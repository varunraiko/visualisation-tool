Project Description:
Visualization would show us a graph where the nodes would be representing the medical entities and edges would show the relation between different medical entities.
Frequent Itemset of medical entites - would output frequent itemset for a given support.

Prerequisites:
Mozilla firefox 50.0
python 2.7.6

Installation
visualisation tool - run visualisation/index.html on Firefox
frequent itemset - run ./code/freqItemsets/categorise_terms.py

Features:
Frequent Itemsets
1) User would be asked to give a support value as input and then the frequent itemsets will be displayed.

Visualisation Tool:
1) Filters by: 
   a) Node Degree: All nodes greater than a particular value for degree are displayed.
   b) Node Frequency: All nodes greater than a particular frequency are displayed.
   c) Edge Weight: All edgess greater than a particular weight are displayed.
   d) Node Type: All nodes which belong to a particular type are displayed. The types being Treatement, Test and Problem
   e) Node Degree: All nodes greater than a particular value are displayed. These values can be changed by the user.

2)Search box to find any medical term in the graph that is visualised. In the search we actually match the query that we searched in our search box with all of the nodes and all the nodes which have that query are displayed. The shape and color of the searched nodes are changed. Currently we support 4 searches after which these colors repeat themselves.

3) Zoom in and out: This is highly important as the graph we visualise is a dense one and to see connection the zoom feature is essential.

4) Reset Filters: This is used to reset the graph to the original state. All nodes are restored to original color and size.

5) Node labels are attached and you can see when you hover on the node.
